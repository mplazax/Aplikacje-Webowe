    <h1>Time to place our bets: Europe’s AI opportunity</h1>
    <p class="author">Andrzej Duda</p>
    <p>
      A three-lens approach–on adoption, creation, and energy–is required to
      assess Europe’s competitiveness in the emerging generative AI (gen AI)
      economy. While much of the current discourse centers around large language
      models (LLMs), European policy makers and business leaders must look
      beyond LLMs. Adopting a holistic approach to capitalize fully on gen AI’s
      potential could boost European labor productivity by up to 3 percent
      annually through 2030.
    </p>
    <p>
      On adoption, European organizations lag behind their US counterparts by 45
      to 70 percent. Yet this is where most of gen AI’s economic potential lies.
      With the technology still in its early stages and much of its productivity
      gains yet to be unlocked, the window of opportunity for Europe remains
      wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      On creation, Europe leads in only one of the eight segments of a
      simplified gen AI value chain: AI semiconductor equipment. Europe is a
      challenger in three other segments: foundation models, AI applications,
      and AI services. But it has below 5 percent market share in the remaining
      four: raw materials, AI semiconductor design, AI semiconductor
      manufacturing, and cloud infrastructure and supercomputers.
